# Mask settings determine how the multiple sequence alignment is masked prior to phylogenetic inference.
# Added 2021-03-23 to mask sites that are not part of the nucleocapsid gene

mask:
  # Number of bases to mask from the beginning and end of the alignment. These cover everything up to the beginning
  # of the nucleocapsid CDS (mask_from_beginning) and after its end (mask_from_end)
  mask_from_beginning: 28273
  mask_from_end: 370

  # Specific sites to mask in the reference genome's coordinates.
  # These are 1-indexed coordinates of sites that have been identified as prone to sequencing errors.
  # 13402, 24389 and 24390 are restricted to Belgian samples
  mask_sites: "13402 24389 24390"
  
# Filter settings
filter:
  # Require nearly full length nucleocapsid gene CDS.
  min_length: 1200
  
# Use nextalign instead of MAFFT (appropriate for larger datasets)
genes: ["N"]
use_nextalign: true

# Distance setting
distance: "N"

# Custom subsampling logic for global region, taken from a nextstrain global build in their github
