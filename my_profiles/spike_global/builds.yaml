# This is where we define which builds we'd like to run.
# This example includes one minimal global build.

# Each build needs a name, a defined subsampling process, and geographic attributes used for subsampling.
# Geography is specified by build attributes (e.g., `region`, `country`, `division`, `location`) that are referenced from subsampling schemes.

# The default config file, `./defaults/parameters.yaml` has reasonable default subsampling methods for each geographic resolution.
# These subsample primarily from the area of interest ("focus"), and add in background ("contextual") sequences from the rest of the world.
# Contextual sequences that are genetically similar to (hamming distance) and geographically near the focal sequences are heavily prioritized.

# In this example, we use these default methods. See other templates for examples of how to customize this subsampling scheme.
builds:
  spike_global: #build name
    subsampling_scheme: region_global #subsample from the globe
    region: global #Don't filter sequences based on geographic origin

# Here, you can specify what type of auspice_config you want to use
# and what description you want. These will apply to all the above builds.
# If you want to specify specific files for each build - you can!
# See the 'example_advanced_customization' builds.yaml

# Mask settings determine how the multiple sequence alignment is masked prior to phylogenetic inference.

mask:
  # Number of bases to mask from the beginning and end of the alignment. These cover everything up to the beginning
  # of the spike CDS (mask_from_beginning) and after its end (mask_from_end)

  # Specific sites to mask in the reference genome's coordinates.
  # These are 1-indexed coordinates of sites that have been identified as prone to sequencing errors.
  # 13402, 24389 and 24390 are restricted to Belgian samples

# Use nextalign instead of MAFFT (appropriate for larger datasets)
