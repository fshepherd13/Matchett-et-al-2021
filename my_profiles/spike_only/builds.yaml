# Mask settings determine how the multiple sequence alignment is masked prior to phylogenetic inference.
# Added 2021-03-23 to mask sites that are not part of the spike gene

mask:
  # Number of bases to mask from the beginning and end of the alignment. These cover everything up to the beginning
  # of the spike CDS (mask_from_beginning) and after its end (mask_from_end)
  mask_from_beginning: 21562
  mask_from_end: 4519

  # Specific sites to mask in the reference genome's coordinates.
  # These are 1-indexed coordinates of sites that have been identified as prone to sequencing errors.
  # 13402, 24389 and 24390 are restricted to Belgian samples
  mask_sites: "13402 24389 24390"
  
# Filter settings
filter:
  # Require nearly full length spike gene CDS.
  min_length: 3800
  
# Use nextalign instead of MAFFT (appropriate for larger datasets)
genes: ["S"]
use_nextalign: true

#Specifying different root because of the way I had to uniquely rename the strains, using data
#directly from GISAID rather than from Nextstrain's reformatted data
refine:
  root: "Wuhan/WH01/2019" #EPI_ISL_406798; 08Apr21- Tree refining step keeps trimming Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 which makes the rebuild step fail, so I'm attempting to use only the WH01 sequence as the root since they are the 100% identical in the spike gene anyway.
